# Virtual Machines
Virtual machines (VMs) are a type of software that, that exist and run on a physical machine. Vms provide a complete system environment (including an operating system) that allows multiple isolated environments, each with its own resources, configuration, and installed software, to run on a single physical machine independently. 

# Vagrant
Vagrant is a virtual machine management tool that provides a simple, consistent workflow for creating and managing virtual environments, allowing developers to work with a variety of systems, configurations, and dependencies.

With Vagrant. You define your virtual machine's configuration in a single file. This file specifies   The operating system, network configuration, and any software that should be installed on the virtual machine. The best part  is that, the virtual machine can then be automatically set up, run, and accessed remotely using Vagrant.

# Why Use Vagrant and Virtual Machines
- Vagrant allows you to ensure that your development environment is consistent across your team, regardless of the operating systems they use. 
- Vagrant can be used to automatically set up virtual machines, making it simple to replicate builds and test results.
- Virtual machines provide separation between the host and guest systems, allowing software and configurations to be tested without affecting the host system.
- Vagrant allows you to easily share virtual machine configurations among team members or move them to different systems.
